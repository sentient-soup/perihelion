## Future Goals

Eventually I would like to integrate some sort of hypervisor that can dynamically scale. Such as using proxmox with something like terraform and ansible to manage vm deployments across hosts. For now, simply sticking to kubernetes on baremetal is sufficient for my purposes. Especially given the hardware and power limitations I'm currently working with.
